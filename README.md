CS380 Group Project
Our group wants to form a company around selling keyboard items to customers. Customers
would have the option of purchasing the keyboard completely or just buying parts separately.
These individual parts would include pieces like keycaps, switches, stabilizers, RGB, etc. The
company would offer a multitude of options for all customers in different price ranges, there
would be high-end and low-end options. Due to the company being fully online, all payments
would be made through credit card.
